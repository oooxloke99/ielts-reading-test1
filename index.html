      <h2>A new role for livestock guard dogs</h2>

      <p>
        Livestock guard dogs, traditionally used to protect farm animals from predators, are 
        now being used to protect the predators themselves.
      </p>

      <p><strong>A.   </strong>
        For thousands of years, livestock guard dogs worked alongside shepherds to protect 
        their sheep, goats and cattle from predators such as wolves and bears. But in the 
        19th and 20th centuries, when such predators were largely exterminated, A most 
        guard dogs lost their jobs. In recent years, however, as increased efforts have 
        been made to protect wild animals, predators have become more widespread again. 
        As a result, farmers once more need to protect their livestock, and guard dogs 
        are enjoying an unexpected revival.
      </p>

      <p><strong>B.   </strong>
        Today there are around 50 breeds of guard dogs on duty in various parts of the world. 
        These dogs are raised from an early age with the animals they will be watching and 
        eventually these animals become the dog's family. The dogs will place themselves 
        between the livestock and any threat, barking loudly. If necessary, they will 
        chase away predators, but often their mere presence is sufficient. "Their initial 
        training is to make them understand that livestock is going to be their life," says 
        Dan Macon, a shepherd with three guard dogs. 'A fluffy white puppy is fun to be 
        around, but too much human affection makes it a great dog for guarding the front 
        porch, rather than a great livestock guard dog."
      </p>

      <p><strong>C.    </strong>
        The evidence indicates that guard dogs are highly effective. For example, in 
        Portugal, biologist Silvia Ribeiro has found that more than 90 per cent of the farmers 
        participating in a programme to train and use guard dogs to protect their herds 
        against attack from wolves rate the performance of the dogs as very good or excellent. 
        In a study carried out in Australia by Linda van Bommel and Chris Johnson at the 
        University of Tasmania, more than 65 per cent of herders reported that predation 
        stopped completely after they got the dogs, and almost all the rest saw a decrease in 
        attacks. 'If they are managed and used properly, livestock guard dogs are the most 
        efficient control method that we have in terms of the amount of livestock that they 
        save from predation,' says van Bommel.
      </p>

      <p><strong>D.    </strong>
        But today's guard dogs also have a new role to help preserve the predators. It is hoped 
        that reductions in livestock losses can make farmers more tolerant of predators and 
        less likely to kill them. In Namibia, more than 90 per cent of cheetahs live outside 
        protected areas, close to humans raising livestock. As a result, the cheetahs are often 
        held responsible for animal losses, and large numbers have been killed by farmers. When 
        guard dogs were introduced, more than 90 per cent of farmers reported a dramatic 
        reduction in livestock losses, and said that as a result they were less likely to kill 
        predators, Julie Young, at Utah State University in the US, believes this result applies 
        widely. "There is common ground from the livestock perspective and from the conservation 
        perspective, she says. If ranchers don't have a dead cow, they will not make a call to 
        apply for a permit to kill a wolf."
      </p>

      <p><strong>E.    </strong>
        Looking at all the published evidence, Bethany Smith at Nottingham Trent University in 
        the UK found that up to 88 per cent of farmers said they no longer killed predators 
        after using dogs-but wamed that such self-reported results must be taken with a pinch of 
        salt. What's more, it is possible that livestock guard dogs merely displace predators to 
        unprotected neighbouring properties, where their fate Isn't recorded. "In some regions, 
        we work with almost every farmer, but in others only one or two have dogs," says Ribeiro. 
        "If we are not working with everybody, we are transferring the wolf pressure to the 
        neighbour's herd and he can use poison and kill an entire pack of wolves."
      </p>

      <p><strong>F.    </strong>
        Another concern is whether there may be unintended ecological effects of using guard dogs. 
        Studies suggest that reducing deaths of one type of predator may have a negative impact 
        on other species. The extent of this problem isn't known, but the consequences are clear 
        in Namibia. Cheetahs aren't the only species that cause sheep and goat losses there: other 
        predators also attack livestock. In 2015, researchers reported that in spite of the impact 
        farmers obtaining guard dogs had on cheetahs, the number of jackals killed by dogs and 
        people actually increased. Guard dogs have other ecological impacts too. They have been 
        found to spread diseases to wild animals, including endangered Ethiopian wolves. They may 
        also compete with other carnivores for food. And by creating a 'landscape of fear', their 
        mere presence can influence the behaviour of prey animals.
      </p>

            <p><strong>G.    </strong>
        The evidence so far, however, indicates that these consequences aren't always negative. 
              Guard dogs can deliver unexpected benefits by protecting vulnerable wildlife from 
              predators. For example, their presence has been found to protect birds which build 
              their nests on the ground in fields, where foxes would normally raid them. Indeed, 
              Australian researchers are now using dogs to enhance biodiversity and create refuges 
              for species threatened by predation. So if we can get this right, there may be a 
              bright future for guard dogs in promoting harmonious coexistence between humans and 
              wildlife.

        <p> 
          In Namibia, livestock guard dogs have been used to protect domestic animals from attacks by cheetahs.
          This has led to a rise in the deaths of other predators, particularly <strong>11.</strong>
          <input type="text" data-q="11" class="blank">
          In addition, it has been suggested that the dogs could have <strong>12.</strong>
