      <h2>Reading Passage</h2>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 1</strong></p>
      <p>
        Climate change is one of the most significant challenges facing the world today.
        Rising global temperatures have led to extreme weather events, melting glaciers,
        and rising sea levels.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 2</strong></p>
      <p>
        Scientists agree that human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels,
        are the main cause of climate change. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
        trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 3</strong></p>
      <p>
        Governments and individuals can take action to reduce emissions by using renewable
        energy, improving energy efficiency, and changing consumption habits.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Paragraph 4</strong></p>
      <p>
        International cooperation is essential to address climate change effectively.
        Agreements such as the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming.
